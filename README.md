# Machine Learning Portfolio
In this portfolio found [here](https://github.com/sovanna4/Machine-Learning-Portfolio) I was able to get some hands-on experience with machine learning through various projects using **R, Python, and C++**. Moreover, some of the technical skills I gained through this course include:
1. **Data Preprocessing and Analysis**: data cleaning and ensuring that the data is prepared for the machine learning models
2. **Machine Learning Algorithms**: in this course we learned about regression, classification, deep learning, and clustering
3. **Model Evaluation**: using various functions, we are provided ways to better understand the data we are evaluating
4. **Data Visualization**: through various plots, charts, and graphs we are able to interpret the data given

While, the technical skills have been very valuable to my tool kit, I have also been able to hone my soft skills through this course. Some of those skills include:
1. **Communication**: being able to understand both the written and verbal requirements of the project given in class
2. **Teamwork**: collaborating with others and ensuring that we stay on task and deliver our project successfully as a team
3. **Adaptability**: being able to learn the skills required for the project quickly to ensure that I deliver on time and on scope of the project
4. **Problem-Solving**: having the ability to navigate through new challenges and even getting used to new languages (R and Python)
